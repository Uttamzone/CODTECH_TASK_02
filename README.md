Overview of the Project
This project involves implementing and training a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to play a complex game. The goal is to leverage RL techniques to enable the agent to learn optimal strategies for maximizing performance within the game's environment. The complexity of the game provides a challenging testbed for evaluating state-of-the-art RL algorithms.

Objective
Develop an RL agent capable of learning and executing strategies to play a complex game effectively.
Train the agent to achieve high performance, measured by game-specific metrics like score, level progression, or other objectives defined by the game.
Demonstrate the applicability of RL techniques in solving real-world complex decision-making problems.
Key Activities

Define the Game Environment:
Select or create a game environment that is complex enough to challenge the RL agent.
Ensure the environment complies with standardized interfaces like OpenAI Gym, if applicable.

Design the RL Algorithm:
Choose an appropriate RL approach (e.g., Deep Q-Learning, Policy Gradients, Actor-Critic methods).
Customize the algorithm to handle the unique challenges of the selected game.

Implement the Agent:
Develop the RL agent, including state representation, action selection, reward calculation, and update mechanisms.
Incorporate neural networks if using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Training:
Train the agent through iterative episodes, allowing it to interact with the environment and learn from rewards and penalties.
Fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize learning efficiency and performance.

Evaluation and Testing:
Evaluate the agentâ€™s performance using metrics such as average rewards, success rate, or stability of policies.
Test the agent in unseen game scenarios to assess generalization.

Analysis and Documentation:
Analyze the learning curves, agent behaviors, and key insights from the training process.
Document the methodology, results, and challenges for further improvement.
